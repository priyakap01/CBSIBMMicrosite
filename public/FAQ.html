                1.How Cloud Business Solutions Compare to Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)?
            </p>
            <p class="AnswerClass">
                Cloud Business Solutions are different from Software-as-a-Service in that they are:<br>
                <ul style="font-size:17px;">
                <li>Single tenant.</li>
                <li>Leverage multiple loosely coupled software products, assets, and data sets.</li>
                <li> Coupled with the ability to bring the solution 'in house' in the future.</li>                             
                <li>When Software-as-a-Service is not a fit, Cloud Business Solutions can provide many of the same benefits like trading off personalization for automated upgrades.</li>
              </ul>

                2.What is the difference between a private or hybrid cloud?
            </p>
            <p class="AnswerClass">
              A Private Cloud is cloud infrastructure operated exclusively for the purpose of a single Customer, whether "on-premise" or "off-premise".  The actual management of the cloud infrastructure can be performed by the Enterprise itself, or by a third-party. A Hybrid Cloud is an integration of multiple clouds, private or public, offering the benefits of multi-deployment models.  Hybrid models can support multiple cloud service providers.  Cloud Business Solutions will be offered in Private or Hybrid models only.

                3. What is special about a single client agreement, and how will we accomplish this?
            </p>
            <p class="AnswerClass">
                Cloud Business Solutions will enable IBM to deliver on the promise of ‘One IBM’, while providing industry relevance and compelling client value. By providing an integrated solution through a single client agreement and pricing model, rather than individual agreements for software, services, and hosting, it will be simpler for clients to buy from IBM. Financially, subscription/usage-based pricing reduces the reliance on capital funding, thus empowering line of business leaders to fund more through operating budgets.

                4.What is annuity based pricing?
            </p>
            <p class="AnswerClass">
                <ul style="font-size:17px;">
                  <li>One contract, one price, one monthly invoice</li>
                <li>All or most software and infrastructure bundled into the subscription/usage-based pricing</li>
              <li>Up front on-boarding and (partial) implementation one time charges (often milestone-based) plus monthly ‘rental’ fee</li>
              <li>Termination fees for early exit</li>
              <li>IGF Financing can assist in smoothing some of the implementation fees across multi-year term </li>
              <li>Cross and up-sell opportunities over contract duration – get ‘foot in door’, then expand</li>
              <li>Margin improvement opportunity given pricing is not typically based on person x quantity of hours (e.g. leverage people across clients)</li>
              <li>Less revenue over initial months, with benefit of ‘locking in’ larger, longer-term revenue stream</li>

If a client already has licensed software, they are not precluded from participating in Cloud Business Solutions solutions. They can utilize currently available licenses and complement them with new products and services.
</li>
                <li>For some SWG products that are a part of the Cloud Business Solutions solutions, the clients will sign a Cloud Business Solutions contract and not separately license the software.</li>
              <li>For some SWG products that are a part of the Cloud Business Solutions solutions, perpetual licenses will still be required and the Client will license those separately. These will be handled on a case by case basis</li>

                6.How would we provide client's the option of transitioning the solution 'in house'?
            </p>
            <p class="AnswerClass">
                While our Cloud Business Solutions offering focuses primarily on subscription-based solutions, the possibility exists that our client’s may eventually desire the ability to bring their solution  ‘in house’.  The Acceleration Team will assist you with developing the appropriate terms and conditions to accommodate a potential transition to an “in house” solution.
